'''
Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes by level from the leaves up. Return an array of arrays 
representing the values of the leaves at each iteration.

The result will have the leaves of the tree (no matter the depth from the root) in the first array (index zero), 
and then the root will be in the last by itself. See the examples below.
