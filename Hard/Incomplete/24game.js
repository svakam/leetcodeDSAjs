// (a) Choose any two numbers from the array and perform a mathematical operation on them. This will result in a new value.
// (b) Remove the two numbers used in step (a), and replace them with the new value.
// (c) Repeat steps (a) and (b) with the updated array until the array only contains one number.
// (d) If this number is 2424, then we found a result. Otherwise, we backtrack and try selecting the numbers in a different order or using a different permutation of mathematical operations.
